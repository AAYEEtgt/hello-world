## Welcome to AAYEE's Great Transtion project. 


Our Challenge is the following : to reduce loneliness of at least 50 persons using dating apps by June 2020. Our solution? Listen. Here is a detailed outline of the situation and our proposed concept.

**Problem**

_What we know about the context_

Loneliness is a complex and unpleasant emotion. It typically arises when there is a lack of social connection or communication. Loneliness is widespread throughout society amongst people who are single, in a relationship or even married. This social pain is intensified with the presence of dating apps. Dating applications are much more accessible than dating websites now. It requires less information (text, name, age etc.) and they offer the opportunity to meet up with strangers whenever and wherever. Although dating apps can broaden social interactions in theory, people still find it difficult to cultivate deep and intimate connections. The increasing use of applications raised a lot of questions amongst psychologists on their impact on loneliness. Psychologist Melissa G. Hunt and her team made an experimental study on the well being of two groups of undergraduate students, one being limited to 10 minutes use of facebook, instagram and snapchat and the other one continuing using it as usual. This experiment provides us an interesting outcome :the group with limited access to those applications showed an important decrease in loneliness and depression. A question can be raised through this study : what about dating apps ? 

Tinder, created in 2012, is one of the major online applications with more than 57 million users around the world. The application is available in 190 countries and 40 different languages. According to a survey released by LenEdu (consumer financing company) on 3,800 millennials aged between 18 and 22 years old on how they meet up with their tinder matches, 70% do not meet their matches. They also found that 44% of millennials go on the application to boost their own confidence. We can see that there is a ‘swiping culture’ of virtual validation. Dating apps like Tinder encourages people to establish a carefully curated online presentation (we only show what we want others to see) According to the Ohio State University, people who describe themselves as lonely and socially anxious tend to be more addicted to dating apps which contributes to the creation of a loneliness cycle and even depression and anxiety.

_What problem are we answering?_

Dating apps which were created to reduce loneliness by allowing one another to meet their significant other, contributes to the feeling of loneliness, anxiety and to some extent depression. It is especially true amongst university students who interact in an overwhelming environment. How can we reduce the impact that dating apps have on loneliness, anxiety, loss of self-confidence or even depression? Through our solution we would like to reduce loneliness on at least 50 students using dating apps at Sciences Po Paris, Parisian campus, by june 2020. 

_What’s at stake?_

According to sociologist erik Erikson’s stages of psychological development, young adults struggle to find a balance between intimacy and isolation. He believes that we sometimes feel isolated due to intimacy as we are afraid of rejections like being turned down or our partners breaking up with us. To some, the idea of being rejected is so painful that their egos cannot bear the consequences. During young adulthood, people at this stage of life struggles to form reciprocal and successful romantic relationship. Therefore, our target group of people are young students from Sciences Po Paris campus. We believe that the feeling of loneliness and isolation peaks for our targeted group of people. 

_What needs? what constraints?_

Young adults need to feel accepted and loved. However, we live in a fast and superficial digital world where people’s feelings are sometimes neglected. People need to find a way to comfortably be themselves: to be heard and understood. To build an emotional connection with others, we need to find new ways to interact with other people. As it is not possible to put an end to the use of dating applications, it would be interesting to see how to rethink these applications in order to entail these new social components. 

_Why is this problem important?_

The feeling of isolation and loneliness is prevalent in universities in big cities like Sciences Po Paris. According to the Observatoire de la vie étudiante, amongst the students questioned, 25% of students suffer from loneliness. The fast-paced environment and the rise of technology makes it difficult to meet people in a traditional manner. This leads to the popular use of dating apps. However, the use of dating apps can result in various problems. Firstly, it creates and intensifies the sense of loneliness. Dating applications promote virtual interactions that can be immensely different than reality. As they allow the “hide behind a screen” effect, people tend to let aside some communication etiquette. ‘Ghosting’, a practice of ending a personal relationship with someone by suddenly withdrawing from all communication without explanation, can lead to psychological trauma. Secondly, dating apps creates a superficial culture where people are judged based on the way they look as well as the way they text. This can lead to serious issues such as racial profiling, ageism, homophobia and misogyny. People are becoming more and more anxious and afraid of being judged and rejected based on the way they look. Thirdly, since users may have vastly different intentions (from genuine relationships to one night stands), people may be mismatched and feel disappointed. Dating apps can also lead to other serious problems such as stalking and sexual harassment. Although technology allows us to communicate with other people easier, it seems like forming intimate relationships are becoming harder and harder. 

**Are we facing a form of ‘Uberization of love’?**

**Proposed concept : “Listen”**

“Listen” is a dating application that differs itself from its competitors on the dating application landscape.  It is neither a “fast-dating” application nor an application based on physical appearances. “Listen” is a dating application centered on voice sharing and aiming at building a strong bond by allowing trust and confidence between its users. Thus the application entails multiple steps :

_Step One_ : Find a matchRegular dating apps based on catalogue-like user photos entails the emergence of a loss of confidence that can progressively affect people’s interactions with one another and contribute to the development of a feeling of loneliness. Voice, on the other hand, is a rich source of information for those who listen. In addition to being a medium of communication, it allows physical and social assessments. Furthermore, according to a huge body of research (Collin S., Missing C., Riding D. and Brown B.), voice is linked to human sexuality and is an important factor in defining attractiveness in someone. It is more intimate than pictures and can lead to less superficial “matches” between users. 

_Step Two_ : Interaction!This is the most important step in the first development of a bond between the two users. Having the option of sending voice recordings, as well as texts for users who do not have the possibility to record or are more comfortable with typing, creates a more active form of conversation. Laughter, hesitations, tone of voice… These are all primordial elements in an interaction that are unfortunately lost when texting. Similarly to a phone call, with “Listen”, the users will be fully invested in the discussion and will be less passive or uninvolved than with regular dating apps. The “hiding behind a screen” effect will be less present or erased as interacting through voice notes will foster the creation of a deeper and more real first connection. 

_Step Three_ : Revelation. Once both parties feel at ease with each other, they will have the ability to reveal their pictures by clicking on a button. The application will then release the photos that users have uploaded when creating their account. As a security measure, no user can create an account without confirming its identity with a picture. The goal of this later revelation is to have users appreciate each other and develop a bond based on more than just looks. 
Final Step : The first date. If everything goes well in the previous steps, it will be time for the users to organize a meet-up based on their actual interests and common points and perhaps create the foundation to what may become a relationship. 

The multiple numbers of step will create a form of autoselection of users using the app. On top of that, additional features are added to provide psychological assistance to the users at every step : 

_Chatbot_
Helping out the users in figuring out the kind of situation they are confronted to, trying to deal with problems of rejection, doubts or just having questions on the functionning of the application. The chatbot will be a form of  psychological assistance users can rely on. It will be handled by trained psychologists hired by Listen to help our users: from teaching users how to be more confident and love themselves, to help them deal with rejection... Due to the impossibility of having professionals available 24h/7, booking psychological sessions will be possible through the application. The application will also aim at normalizing psychological sessions which can deal with negative stereotypes. 

_Uniqueness of Listen?_
The psychological assistance and the use of the “voice” as central parts of the project are what distinguish Listen from what has been done until now on the dating application landscape. This creativity will definitely trigger interest from potential users as well as answer their need to create more connections with potential partners. 
As seen above, voice is an essential factor that impacts people’s way of defining attractiveness. Through vocal interactions, people express themselves and communicate with each other. It allows a degree of intimacy that other senses can’t provide. In a world where almost everything seems to have replaced voice interactions (mails, messaging apps), the users are invited to disclose themselves through a sense that can reveal a lot about someone’s personality and sensibility. It will allow them to feel less objectified, to develop a more healthy relationship with each other. The psychological assistance that will be provided to them will also contribute to that as well as trivializing a profession that has been negatively perceived by some parts of the population. 
The project seems to be completely feasible but will definitely require us to complete our knowledge with hard skills.
